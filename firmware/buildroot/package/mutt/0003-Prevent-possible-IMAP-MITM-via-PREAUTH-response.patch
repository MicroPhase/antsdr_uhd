Subject: [PATCH] Prevent possible IMAP MITM via PREAUTH response.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is similar to CVE-2014-2567 and CVE-2020-12398.  STARTTLS is not
allowed in the Authenticated state, so previously Mutt would
implicitly mark the connection as authenticated and skip any
encryption checking/enabling.

No credentials are exposed, but it does allow messages to be sent to
an attacker, via postpone or fcc'ing for instance.

Reuse the $ssl_starttls quadoption "in reverse" to prompt to abort the
connection if it is unencrypted.

Thanks very much to Damian Poddebniak and Fabian Ising from the
MÃ¼nster University of Applied Sciences for reporting this issue, and
their help in testing the fix.
